## Random Forest Approach Of Specific Splicing

With realizing stochastic nature of alternative splicing, on top of normal probabilistic way of stimulating all possible isoforms through specific donor sites and acceptors probabilities, we attached a random forest head to post hidden markov model probability calculation for further estimation of whole Alternative Splicing event in a denser scope.
